This project is a Clinic Management System focused on the PAM (Patient Appointment Management) module, developed using Spring Boot. It provides RESTful APIs to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing patient and appointment records. Data handling is optimized through efficient use of Spring Data JPA with a PostgreSQL database. API endpoints are tested and validated using Postman with JSON payloads to ensure accuracy and reliability. This module enables seamless patient registration, appointment scheduling, updates, and deletions, supporting future scalability for additional modules like Doctor Management and Billing within the larger Clinic Management System.
